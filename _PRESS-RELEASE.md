# Is Fred's Shirt Black Today #

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Fred wears black shirts. ##
  > We all know this.  Many of us suspect that all of the shirts are the same.  We need a place to compare these shirts and examine them for differences.

## Do other shirts exist?  ##
  > No one can be sure.  We have seen no evidence thus far.  This must be rectified.

## Summary ##
  > We all have benefited from the great teachings of Fred.  This forum will celebrate the greatness of the man and the fashion.

## Where is it appropriate to celebrate Fred? ##
  > Many times I have wondered how to express gratitude for the teachings of Hack Reactor and Fred.  Sprint reflections offer a great opportunity to start my day practicing gratitude, but alas, these don't occur every morning.

## The solution ##
  > This site will offer a 24/7 forum where those who know the glory of Fred can post their thanks, share the sage advice of Fred, and let each other know whether or not Fred's shirt is black today.

## Quote ##
  > "Every day is better when it begins remembering what you are thankful for with pictures."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Simply log in with GitHub to verify your status as a Hack Reactee, then proceed to praise Fred.

## Visitor Quote ##
  > "Thank you for providing a one-stop shop for all the Fred I've ever wanted."

## Call to Action ##
  > I believe that all students and staff can benefit from having a place to give positive feedback about Hack Reactor and Fred as soon as it comes to mind, so that they can look back at it when coding inevitably gets frustrating.  Thanks for reading my proposal, and stay tuned for our sister site 'Did Marcus Tie His Tie Today?'
